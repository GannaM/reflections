1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

I create a place where I will store my versions/commits.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is a temporary storage that is to be commited. It allows to commit only specific files while ignoring others.


3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

Compare staging area with the working directory or a recent commit, use git diff and git diff --staged respectively


4. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

When you do experiments with possible solution or add a localized version.


5. How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

They show the sequence of branches and their commint in a clear and orginized way.


6. What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

We merge the branches so that the final result contains properties of the both branches. 


What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
