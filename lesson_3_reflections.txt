1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you complete implementing new features.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    To avoid merging conflicts, to have a better control over the versions, etc.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Branche is just another series of commits. Clone - is a copy of the whole repository. Fork is also a clone of a repository which exists on a remote server (such as GitHub). You create a Fork, when you are not allowed to edit the original repository, but would like to commit some changes. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
